# Solidity studies

This repo contains studies of the Solidity language. These studies are based on the [Solidity by example](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/solidity-by-example.html) documentation available in the Solidity official website.

My approach in this repository was to re-implement the examples using a TDD approach. To run the tests just run the command below:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
